# Comparative-Study-on-ML-Algorithmn-for-Defective-Package-Detection-System
  The comparative study on ML algorithms for defective package detection is a comparison between different algorithms to classify the package as damaged or intact. This project addresses the critical concern of managing product quality in the field of manufacturing production. The primary objective of this project is to deliver a non-defective package to the customer. To achieve this goal, Machine learning utilizes classification algorithms like the decision tree algorithm, the Random Forest algorithm, and the Logistic regression algorithm. Data is collected from Kaggle and those data are used to train the model in JupyterLab in Python language to identify defective packages. Our investigation yielded that the Logistic regression algorithm is better than other algorithms. This is because the performance of the Logistic regression algorithm is higher and also the Logistic regression algorithm is easy to understand and implement. Furthermore, integrating quantum networking into this system could enhance data security and processing speed, facilitating real-time defect detection and quality control in industrial settings.
